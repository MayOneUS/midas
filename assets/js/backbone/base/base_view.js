// This class implements a paradigm wherein it renders its own child class.
// Doing this allows us to perform logic against it.

// NOTES:
// 'this' refers to the prototype class, not the constructor (logical this).
// This is very useful for smaller el regions, such as a task list
// or anything that requires a small spinner.  Currently to add a bigger spinner
// I'd have to exchange the gif currently provided by font-awesome.
